/*
 *  HISTORY:
 *
 *	0.2.1	First distribution.
 *
 *	0.2.2	Comments, documentation, increased routing table to 128.
 *
 *	0.3.0	Added the "myalias" stuff, and began work on a beacon
 *		mechanism.
 *		Added support for the SIGHUP signal.  Now a "kill -1 <pid>"
 *		will make ax25ip re-read the config file and restart.
 *
 *	0.3.1	Now can specify the internet host by internet number as
 *		well as host name.
 *
 *	0.4.0	Removed "autoadd" references
 *		Added support for sending and listening on UDP sockets.
 *		Added "SIGUSR" handler for dumping statistics on demand.
 *		The Beacon frame is computed only once.
 *		Any I/O errors will result in an exit()... This should be
 *		fixed, specially for the UDP socket, but for the moment
 *		this prevents errors from going wild and consuming vast
 *		amounts of system and user time.
 *		Fixed a bug in the KISSEMIT macro (thanks Jim Durham)
 *		Added support for both termio and termios (thanks Jim Durham)
 *
 *	0.4.1	added a generic "io_error" routine to handle errors in the
 *		main processing loop.  This is in hopes of building a mech-
 *		anism that can deal with temporary network failures in a
 *		more robust fashion.
 *
 *	0.4.2	added support for the BSD sgtty method for setting and
 *		controlling the serial port.
 *
 *	1.0.0	modifications to bring ax25ip into line with the standard
 *		linux ax25 tools distribution. (vk5xxx)
 *
 *	1.0.1	various cleanups and changes ... now called ax25ipd
 *		added prototypes, fork's itself ... (vk5xxx)
 *
 *	1.0.2	Incorporated patch allowing wildcarding of ax.25 callsigns.
 *		The old method required a route for every call/ssid
 *		combination. (thanks to John Woolner. Wildcarding to be
 *		enhanced later ...
 *
 *      July97  Added support for broadcast addresses and routes.
 *              Converted route array to a linked list and removed the
 *              maximum route limitations. (vk2ktj)
 *
 *	2005-10-26 - dl9sau:
 *		added a new fast and efficient link to the linux kernel ax25
 *              stack, via the ethertap interface.
 *		ax25 goes directly to the bpqether interface in the kernel via
 *		ethertap/tuntap interfaces, which is a much better way than
 *              traditional kissattach to a ttyp/ptyp pair.
