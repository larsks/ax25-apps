AX25 Apps
========

Listen now by default is NOT setuid root which means that normal users will
not be able to run it out of the box.  If you want everyone to run
listen then after installing the binaries as root type
  chmod u+s /usr/bin/listen
This version includes support for Mat DG2FEF's new AX.25 subsystem. Binaries
are not interchangeable but require recompile.
